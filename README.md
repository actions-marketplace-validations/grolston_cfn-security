# cfn-security

A simple `GitHub Action` for AWS CloudFormation static code analysis to improve infrastructure-as-code security.

***The Action does not require AWS credentials!***

## Usage

To get started simply add a workflow `.yml` file (name it whatever you would like) to your `.github/workflows` folder. [Refer to the documentation on workflow YAML syntax here.](https://help.github.com/en/articles/workflow-syntax-for-github-actions).

For examples GitHub Actions workflow files check out the [example workflow templates](https://github.com/grolston/cfn-security/workflow-examples). If you still do not know where to start, just use the [all-security-scans.yml](workflow-examples/all-security-scans.yml) template which will create two security scan jobs. Update the template env vars as necessary.

### Example cfn-nag Test

The following example tests CloudFormation with cfn-nag:

```yaml
name: Security Scan

on: [push]

jobs:
  security-scan-nag:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
    - uses: actions/checkout@v1
    - uses: grolston/cfn-security@master
      env:
        CLOUDFORMATION_DIRECTORY: "./cloudformation/"
        TEST: "cfn-nag"
```

### Example checkov Test

The following example tests CloudFormation with checkov:

```yaml
name: Security Scan

on: [push]

jobs:
  security-scan-checkov:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
    - uses: actions/checkout@v1
    - uses: grolston/cfn-security@master
      env:
        CLOUDFORMATION_DIRECTORY: "./cloudformation/"
        TEST: "checkov"
```

### Example Singe Job All Tests

The following example tests CloudFormation with all scanning tools.

> **Note:** it is possible to simple combine the two examples above into a single file which will run all tests as individual jobs. Reference [all-security-scans.yml](workflow-examples/all-security-scans.yml)

The following runs all tests within one job:

```yaml
name: Security Scan

on: [push]

jobs:
  security-scan-all:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
    - uses: actions/checkout@v1
    - uses: grolston/cfn-security@master
      env:
        CLOUDFORMATION_DIRECTORY: "./cloudformation/"
        TEST: "all"
```

### Configuration

The following settings must be passed as environment variables as shown in the example. Sensitive information should be [set as encrypted secrets](https://help.github.com/en/articles/virtual-environments-for-github-actions#creating-and-using-secrets-encrypted-variables) â€” otherwise, they'll be public to anyone browsing your repository's source code and CI logs.

> **Disclaimer:** No sensitive information is needed to conduct testing.

| Env Variable | Description| Suggested Type | Required | Default |
| ------------- | ------------- | ------------- | ------------- | ------------- |
| `CLOUDFORMATION_DIRECTORY` | Directory within your git repository which contains cloudformation templates files | `./cloudformation` | **Yes** | N/A |
| `TEST` | The security test to perform | `cfn-nag` , `checkov`, `all` | **Yes** | N/A |
