    steps:
    - uses: actions/checkout@v1
    - uses: grolston/cfn-security@master
      env:
        CLOUDFORMATION_DIRECTORY: "./cloudformation"
        TEST: "cfn-nag"
```

#### Example checkov Test

The following example tests CloudFormation with checkov:

```yaml
name: Security Scan

on: [push]

    steps:
    - uses: actions/checkout@v1
    - uses: grolston/cfn-security@master
      env:
        CLOUDFORMATION_DIRECTORY: "./cloudformation"
